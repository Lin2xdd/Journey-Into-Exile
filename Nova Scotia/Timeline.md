# Why I want to leave Calgary
- because I don't want to stay in the same place, in my shitty room.
- I want to brerak the cycle and enjoy life and think about my future.

# Why I want to go to Halifax
- I want to enjoy outdoor time and water sports(especially surfing! It has a balance of city life and surfing community)
- It is on the other side of Canada, and I always wanted to explore that
- I want to enjoy outdoor 
- This will be the best timing as I cannot do anything for a short period, and after that I will have to return to my job.

# Will I be able to enjoy the life there?
- finish PGWP before that
- Get a more detailed visit plan(housing, transit, places to visit, mindset shift, etc)
- Only thing to worry about is the work thing
