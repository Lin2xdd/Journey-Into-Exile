# Why I want to leave Calgary
- because I don't want to stay in the same place, in my shitty room.
- I want to brerak the cycle and enjoy life and think about my future.
- I always wanted a gap year/break from my regular life period
- I want to try different stuff

# Why I want to go to Halifax
- I want to enjoy outdoor time and water sports(especially surfing! It has a balance of city life and surfing community)
- It is on the other side of Canada, and I always wanted to explore that
- I want to enjoy outdoor 
- This will be the best timing as I cannot do anything for a short period, and after that I will have to return to my job.
- I haven't been there yet in Canada
- Easy to go to other provinces and also Quebec
- Priority: health and my past and my future 

# Will I be able to enjoy the life there?
- finish PGWP before that
- Get a more detailed visit plan(housing, transit, places to visit, mindset shift, etc)
- Only thing to worry about is the work thing
- Will my body able to adjust to the change for my health and etc? Better apartment and everything else.
- I dont want to be a blind person and waste my time in my life. I actually want something out ot it.
- On he other hand, I feel like I'm not really ready for life yet and I won't be in the mood to do the thing.
- I fear that I will make the same mistake again, with the experience to AU and to Vancouver.
- Will I be able to find the lost self there?
