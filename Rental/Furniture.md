# Ideas
- Big furniture: Ikea, Amazon, veyor
- Bed sheets: Walmart or Amazon or Ikea?


# No.1 batch: mattress & bed & table & chairs
- Idea: let my mom stay with me for the first several months before she compeltely settles. In case she doesn't know how to socialize or she feels lonely and save both of us some money. In the meantime, she can cook for me and get groceries and share the rent, etc; in case I feel lonely.  
- I have a twin sized bed. With the screwdriver I can put it up easily; I will keep it with me, and my mom will sleep in the living room with a queen sized bed mattress. After my mom decides to move out, I will sell the single bed frame and mattress. And keep the queen mattress and frame only.
- Mattress better be new: price not diffeent, with home delivery, plus I'm gonna keep it for a while. bed frame I can purchase second handed.
- Comforter sets for winters too.
- Wayfair: deliver too late, not really cheap; Amazon: deliver fast, cheap, bad reviews; Ikea: not really many choices and not cheap! FB: not really cheap than the online options.
- Common questions about mattress: support on the edge; or sink in the center after a while; or roll to the heavier side if multiple ppl sleep there; ripped package in shipping; dead bugs in the wraps; won't fully inflate; won't inflate to the advertised size; can't roll back and have a full refund
- Idea: check the refund policy. And pick the one that has least bad review!
