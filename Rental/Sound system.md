# Things to consider
- room space, position, music quality, media source, budget.
- Ideas for now: it's a small room. The upgraing won't worth the money spent on bookshelf speakers. And most of the time, I will be sharing the space with my mom, so the sound system won't be necessary. I can save money on next year's stuff.
