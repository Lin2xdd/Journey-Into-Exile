    - push, baseball (horizontal, upward or downward, face and torso facing front, two legs on the same line), shoulder push(lock chins, don't roll shoulders, when elbow touches the body, row your body)

- Deadlifts
     - With dumbells: dumbells in between legs, startpoint and throughout the whole squat, don't stick it front otherwise hurt lower back; roll shoulder blades back; hinge until hamstring completely locked and then squat (there should only be a short distance to squat before the dumbell touches the ground)
     - With bar bell. Legts touch the bar, and then hinge just like squat with dumbells. And when standing up, it's glutes pushing you upward and foward.

- Step up on boxes
  - Same side standup 90 deg, and the other side touch the box to keep balance; going down back lunges and glutes push you up and front.
