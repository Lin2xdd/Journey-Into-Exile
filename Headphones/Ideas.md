# Requirements
- Noise cancelling
- Great texture: strong bass
- Easy to carry? Temprature in winers?
- Over-ear headphones vs earbuds
- Is it easy for mom to carry over?
- Is it chaper to buy local or what?
- Different brands?
- Scenarios: earbuds for workout; headphones for all others.
- Temperature: low temperature itself won't affect the earphones, but lithium battery runs faster in winters; and entering cold to warm place, make sure it's shut down and warmed up before turning it back on(like how glasses work).

# Other things to think about
- Audio codec and phone type; music frequency and more
