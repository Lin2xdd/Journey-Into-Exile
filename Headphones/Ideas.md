# Requirements
- Noise cancelling
- Great texture: strong bass
- Easy to carry? Temprature in winers?
- Over-ear headphones vs earbuds
- Is it easy for mom to carry over?
- Is it chaper to buy local or what?
- Different brands?
- Scenarios: earbuds for workout; headphones for all others.
- Temperature: low temperature itself won't affect the earphones, but lithium battery runs faster in winters; and entering cold to warm place, make sure it's shut down and warmed up before turning it back on(like how glasses work).

# Specs
- Driver unit
The bigger the loudness. And the better the bass is presented. But high freq and thus high pitched voice are harder to capture. 
- Impedance
How much volume is needed to accurately reproduce the sound in each frequency. Below 32 Ohm, you can play on your phone; above that, you will need an amplifier.
- Sensitivity
Like an amplifier. The higher it is, the more the sound gets amplified. Not the higher the better, because some noises and currents will be sent to your ear as well.
